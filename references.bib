The termini of linear chromosomes are protected by specialized {DNA} structures known as telomeres that also facilitate the complete replication of {DNA} ends. The simplest type of telomere is a covalently closed {DNA} hairpin structure found in linear chromosomes of prokaryotes and viruses. Bidirectional replication of a chromosome with hairpin telomeres produces a catenated circular dimer that is subsequently resolved into unit-length chromosomes by a dedicated {DNA} cleavage-rejoining enzyme known as a hairpin telomere resolvase (protelomerase). Here we report a crystal structure of the protelomerase {TelK} from Klebsiella oxytoca phage {$\phi$KO2}, in complex with the palindromic target {DNA.} The structure shows the {TelK} dimer destabilizes base pairing interactions to promote the refolding of cleaved {DNA} ends into two hairpin ends. We propose that the hairpinning reaction is made effectively irreversible by a unique protein-induced distortion of the {DNA} substrate that prevents religation of the cleaved {DNA} substrate.},

We propose that {TRF2} complexes, by constraining {DNA} around themselves in a right-handed conformation, can induce untwisting of the neighboring {DNA}, thereby favoring strand invasion.

Understanding the extent of the diversity of genome organisation, the processes that create it, and its consequences is particularly important for two key reasons. Firstly, it is relevant for our understanding of the genetic basis for the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Elucidating the mechanisms and processes underlying such diversity has been, and remains, one of the central goals of biological research. Secondly, it helps prepare us for our analysis of new genomes. For example, knowing that plasmids can be circular or linear, we know to check for circularity or linearity in a plasmid we encounter for the first time (if this is relevant for our analysis). This article provides an overview of variation and diversity in several aspects of genome organisation and architecture, including the number, size, ploidy, composition {(RNA} or {DNA)}, packaging, and topology of the molecules encoding the genome. Additionally, it reviews differences in selected genomic features, i.e. telomeres, centromeres, {DNA} replication origins, and sex chromosomes. To put this in context, it incorporates a brief survey of organism diversity and the tree of life, and ends with a discussion of mutation mechanisms and inheritance, and explanations of key terms used to describe genomic variation.},

The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed {DNA} hairpins or hairpin telomeres. Replication of these elements involves a unique reaction, called telomere resolution, to produce hairpin telomeres from replicative intermediates. The telomere resolvase, {ResT}, is thought to contribute to the genetic flux of the linear molecules by promoting stabilized telomere fusions. Telomere resolvases are related to the tyrosine recombinases and {ResT} can generate the crucial reaction intermediate of this class of enzyme, the Holliday junction. This observation has led to the proposal that telomere resolvases evolved from tyrosine recombinases inducing {DNA} linearization in the genomes that acquired them.},

Replication initiation systems found on different linear Streptomyces plasmids consist of helicase-like genes and iterons of relatively diverse origins.

Interaction of {TPs} shapes the linear replicon into a circular form, which would allow generation of biologically important superhelicity in terminal {DNA}, but would also create complications during postreplicational segregation of the daughter {DNA.} {TPs} may also be involved in priming initiation of replication during conjugal transfer.

The X-ray crystal structures of both {TRF1-} and {TRF2-Dbds} in complex with telomeric {DNA} (2.0 and 1.8 angstroms resolution, respectively) show that they recognize the same {TAGGGTT} binding site by means of homeodomains, as does the yeast telomeric protein Rap1p. Two of the three {G-C} base pairs that characterize telomeric repeats are recognized specifically and an unusually large number of water molecules mediate {protein-DNA} interactions. The binding of the {TRF2-Dbd} to the {DNA} double helix shows no distortions that would account for the promotion of t-loops in which {TRF2} has been implicated.},

There were no appreciable differences between cells with linear or circular genomes in growth rates, cell and nucleoid morphologies, genome-wide gene expression (with a few exceptions), and {DNA} gyrase- and topoisomerase {IV-dependent} growth. However, under dif-defective conditions, only cells with a circular genome developed an abnormal phenotype.

A complex formed by six telomere-specific proteins associates with this sequence and protects chromosome ends. By analogy to other chromosomal protein complexes such as condensin and cohesin, I will refer to this complex as shelterin. Three shelterin subunits, {TRF1}, {TRF2}, and {POT1} directly recognize {TTAGGG} repeats. They are interconnected by three additional shelterin proteins, {TIN2}, {TPP1}, and Rap1, forming a complex that allows cells to distinguish telomeres from sites of {DNA} damage. Without the protective activity of shelterin, telomeres are no longer hidden from the {DNA} damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by {DNA} repair pathways. How does shelterin avert these events? The current data argue that shelterin is not a static structural component of the telomere. Instead, shelterin is emerging as a protein complex with {DNA} remodeling activity that acts together with several associated {DNA} repair factors to change the structure of the telomeric {DNA}, thereby protecting chromosome ends.

Rap1 mediates silencing at the {HM} loci and at telomeres by recruiting the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins to chromatin via a Rap1 C-terminal domain, which also recruits the telomere length regulators, Rif1 and Rif2. We report the 1.85 A resolution crystal structure of the Rap1 C-terminus, which adopts an all-helical fold with no structural homologues. The structure was used to engineer surface mutations in Rap1, and the effects of these mutations on silencing and telomere length regulation were assayed in vivo. Our surprising finding was that there is no overlap between mutations affecting mating-type and telomeric silencing, suggesting that Rap1 plays distinct roles in silencing at the silent mating-type loci and telomeres. We also found novel Rap1 phenotypes and new separation-of-function mutants, which provide new tools for studying Rap1 function. Yeast two-hybrid studies were used to determine how specific mutations affect recruitment of Sir3, Rif1, and Rif2. A comparison of the yeast two-hybrid and functional data reveals patterns of protein interactions that correlate with each Rap1 phenotype. We find that Sir3 interactions are important for telomeric silencing, but not mating type silencing, and that Rif1 and Rif2 interactions are important in different subsets of telomeric length mutants. Our results show that the role of Rap1 in silencing differs between the {HM} loci and the telomeres and offer insight into the interplay between {HM} silencing, telomeric silencing, and telomere length regulation. These findings suggest a model in which competition and multiple recruitment events modulate silencing and telomere length regulation.},

Recently, the human ortholog of {scRap1p} {(hRap1)} was identified and shown to contain a {BRCT} domain and an {RCT} domain similar to {scRap1p.} However, {hRap1} contained only one recognizable Myb motif in the center of the protein. Furthermore, while {scRap1p} binds telomeric {DNA} directly, {hRap1} has no {DNA-binding} ability. Instead, {hRap1} is tethered to telomeres by {TRF2.} Here, we have determined the solution structure of the Myb domain of {hRap1} by {NMR.} It contains three helices maintained by a hydrophobic core. The architecture of the {hRap1} Myb domain is very close to that of each of the Myb domains from {TRF1}, {scRap1p} and {c-Myb.} However, the electrostatic potential surface of the {hRap1} Myb domain is distinguished from that of the other Myb domains. Each of the minimal {DNA-binding} domains, containing one Myb domain in {TRF1} and two Myb domains in {scRap1p} and {c-Myb}, exhibits a positively charged broad surface that contacts closely the negatively charged backbone of {DNA.} By contrast, the {hRap1} Myb domain shows no distinct positive surface, explaining its lack of {DNA-binding} activity. The {hRap1} Myb domain may be a member of a second class of Myb motifs that lacks {DNA-binding} activity but may interact instead with other proteins. Other possible members of this class are the {c-Myb} R1 Myb domain and the Myb domains of {ADA2} and Adf1.

Careful thought and initial analysis of the {protein-DNA} complex prior to crystallization experiments followed by optimization of crystallization parameters can greatly increase the likelihood of producing well-diffracting crystals.},

Human telomeres are coated by the telomere repeat binding proteins {TRF1} and {TRF2}, which are believed to function independently to regulate telomere length and protect chromosome ends, respectively.


{RESULTS}

Here, we show that {TRF1} and {TRF2} are linked via {TIN2}, a previously identified {TRF1-interacting} protein, and its novel binding partner {TINT1.} {TINT1} localized to telomeres via {TIN2}, where it functioned as a negative regulator of telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. {TIN2} associated with {TINT1}, and {TRF1} or {TRF2} throughout the cell cycle, revealing a partially redundant unit in telomeric chromatin that may provide flexibility in telomere length control. Indeed, when {TRF1} was removed from telomeres by overexpression of the positive telomere length regulator tankyrase 1, the {TIN2/TINT1} complex remained on telomeres via an increased association with {TRF2.}


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our findings suggest a dynamic cross talk between {TRF1} and {TRF2} and provide a molecular mechanism for telomere length homeostasis by {TRF2} in the absence of {TRF1.}},

	abstract = {Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, the pathogenic bacteria that causes crown gall disease in plants, harbors one circular and one linear chromosome and two circular plasmids. The telomeres of its unusual linear chromosome are covalently closed hairpins. The circular and linear chromosomes co-segregate and are stably maintained in the organism. We have determined the sequence of the two ends of the linear chromosome thus completing the previously published genome sequence of A. tumefaciens C58. We found that the telomeres carry nearly identical 25-bp sequences at the hairpin ends that are related by dyad symmetry. We further showed that its Atu2523 gene encodes a protelomerase (resolvase) and that the purified enzyme can generate the linear chromosomal closed hairpin ends in a sequence-specific manner. Agrobacterium protelomerase, whose presence is apparently limited to biovar 1 strains, acts via a cleavage-and-religation mechanism by making a pair of transient staggered nicks invariably at 6-bp spacing as the reaction intermediate. The enzyme can be significantly shortened at both the N and C termini and still maintain its enzymatic activity. Although the full-length enzyme can uniquely bind to its product telomeres, the N-terminal truncations cannot. The target site can also be shortened from the native 50-bp inverted repeat to 26 bp; thus, the Agrobacterium hairpin-generating system represents the most compact activity of all hairpin linear chromosome- and plasmid-generating systems to date. The biochemical analyses of the protelomerase reactions further revealed that the tip of the hairpin telomere may be unusually polymorphically capable of accommodating any nucleotide.},

	abstract = {Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of the linear eukaryotic chromosomes and thereby protect their stability and integrity. Telomeres play central roles in maintaining the genome's integrity, distinguishing between the natural chromosomal ends and unwanted double-stranded breaks. In addition, telomeres are replicated by a special reverse transcriptase called telomerase, in a complex mechanism that is coordinated with the genome's replication. Telomeres also play an important role in tethering the chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, thus helping in positioning the chromosomes within the nucleus. The special chromatin configuration of telomeres affects the expression of nearby genes; nonetheless, telomeres are transcribed, creating noncoding {RNA} molecules that hybridize to the chromosomal ends and seem to play regulatory roles. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with its sophisticated genetics and molecular biology, has provided many fundamental concepts in telomere biology, which were later found to be conserved in all organisms. Here, we present an overview of all the aspects of telomere biology investigated in yeast, which continues to provide new insights into this complex and important subject, which has significant medical implications, especially in the fields of aging and cancer.},

However, anomalous data collected at the Mn edge using a {Rap1-DNA} crystal soaked in potassium permanganate solution indicated that the {DNA} conformation in the crystal was compatible with interaction with permanganate ions. Sequence-conservation analysis revealed that {double-Myb-containing} Rap1 proteins all carry a fully conserved Arg580 at a position that may favour interaction with permanganate ions, although it is not involved in the hypersensitive cytosine distortion. Permanganate reactivity assays with wild-type Rap1 and the {Rap1[R580A]} mutant demonstrated that Arg580 is essential for hypersensitivity. {AFM} experiments showed that wild-type Rap1 and the {Rap1[R580A]} mutant interact with {DNA} over 16 successive binding sites, leading to local {DNA} stiffening but not to accumulation of the observed local distortion. Therefore, Rap1 may cause permanganate hypersensitivity of {DNA} by forming a pocket between the reactive cytosine and Arg580, driving the permanganate ion towards the {C5-C6} bond of the cytosine.},

It is now apparent that versions of the budding yeast {CST} complex and mammalian shelterin are present in multiple phyla. While the precise subunit composition and architecture of these complexes vary between species, the general function is often conserved. Despite the overall conservation of telomere protein complexes, there is still considerable species-specific variation, with some organisms having lost a particular subunit or even an entire complex. In some cases, complex components appear to have migrated between the telomere and the telomerase {RNP.} Finally, gene duplication has created telomere protein paralogs with novel functions.

	abstract = {Phaser is a program for phasing macromolecular crystal structures by both molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods. The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences {DeltaF.} One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional {CCP4} keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic community.},

These covalent labeling methods typically map protein structure and interactions by measuring the differential reactivity of amino acid side chains. The reactivity of amino acids in proteins generally depends on the accessibility of the side chain to the reagent, the inherent reactivity of the label and the reactivity of the amino acid side chain. Peptide mass mapping with {ESI-} or {MALDI-MS} and peptide sequencing with tandem {MS} are typically employed to identify modification sites to provide site-specific structural information. In this review, we describe the reagents that are most commonly used in these residue-specific modification reactions, details about the proper use of these covalent labeling reagents, and information about the specific biochemical problems that have been addressed with covalent labeling strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 28:785{\textendash}815, 2009},

Telomere-binding {TRF2} protein inhibits telomere t-loop deletion by blocking Holliday junction {(HJ)} resolvase cleavage activity, but whether {TRF2} also modulates {HJ} displacement at t-loops is unknown. In this study, we used multiplex fluorophore imaging to track the fate of individual strands of {HJ} substrates. We report the novel finding that {TRF2} inhibits {WRN} helicase strand displacement of {HJs} with telomeric repeats in duplex arms, but unwinding of {HJs} with a telomeric center or lacking telomeric sequence is unaffected. These data, together with results using {TRF2} fragments and {TRF2} {HJ} binding assays, indicate that both the {TRF2} B- and Myb domains are required to inhibit {WRN} {HJ} activity. We propose a novel model whereby simultaneous binding of the {TRF2} B-domain to the {HJ} core and the Myb domain to telomeric arms promote and stabilize {HJs} in a stacked arm conformation that is unfavorable for unwinding. Our biochemical study provides a mechanistic basis for the cellular findings that {TRF2} regulates {WRN} activity at telomeres.},

Eukaryotes navigate these problems with the advent of telomeres, protective nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes, and telomerase, the enzyme that maintains the {DNA} in these structures. Mammalian telomeres contain a specific protein complex, shelterin, that functions to protect chromosome ends from all aspects of the {DNA} damage response and regulates telomere maintenance by telomerase. Recent experiments, discussed here, have revealed how shelterin represses the {ATM} and {ATR} kinase signaling pathways and hides chromosome ends from nonhomologous end joining and homology-directed repair.},

To keep up with the remarkable explosion of knowledge about telomerase, we compiled information related to telomerase in an exhaustive database called the Telomerase Database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/). The Telomerase Database provides comprehensive information about (i) sequences of the {RNA} and protein subunits of telomerase, (ii) sequence alignments based on the phylogenetic relationship and structure, (iii) secondary structures of the {RNA} component and tertiary structures of various subunits of telomerase, (iv) mutations of telomerase components found in human patients and (v) active researchers who contributed to the wealth of current knowledge on telomerase.

By using potassium permanganate probing and differential scanning calorimetry, we reveal that the basic domain of {TRF2} induces structural changes to the junction. We propose that {TRF2} contributes to t-loop stabilisation by stimulating {HJ} formation and by preventing resolvase cleavage. These findings provide novel insights into the interplay between telomere protection and homologous recombination and suggest a general model in which {TRF2} maintains telomere integrity by controlling the turnover of {HJ} at t-loops and at regressed replication forks.},

Previous work has shown that unlike {TRF1}, {TRF2} condenses telomeric, thus creating consequential negative torsion on the adjacent {DNA}, a property that is thought to lead to the stimulation of single-strand invasion and was proposed to favor telomeric {DNA} looping. In this report, we show that these activities, originating from the central {TRFH} domain of {TRF2}, are also displayed by the {TRFH} domain of {TRF1} but are repressed in the full-length protein by the presence of an acidic domain at the N-terminus. Strikingly, a similar repression is observed on {TRF2} through the binding of a {TERRA-like} {RNA} molecule to the N-terminus of {TRF2.} Phylogenetic and biochemical studies suggest that the N-terminal domains of {TRF} proteins originate from a gradual extension of the coding sequences of a duplicated ancestral gene with a consequential progressive alteration of the biochemical properties of these proteins.

	abstract = {Drosophila lacks telomerase and fly telomeres are elongated by occasional transposition of three specialized retroelements. Drosophila telomeres do not terminate with {GC-rich} repeats and are assembled independently of the sequence of chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that Drosophila telomeres are capped by the terminin complex, which includes the fast-evolving proteins {HOAP}, {HipHop}, Moi, and Ver. These proteins, which are not conserved outside Drosophilidae and closely related Diptera, localize and function exclusively at telomeres, protecting them from fusion events. Other proteins required to prevent end-to-end fusion in flies include {HP1}, {Eff/UbcD1}, {ATM}, the components of the {Mre11-Rad50-Nbs} {(MRN)} complex, and the Woc transcription factor. These proteins do not share the terminin properties; they are evolutionarily conserved non-fast-evolving proteins that do not accumulate only at telomeres and do not serve telomere-specific functions. We propose that following telomerase loss, Drosophila rapidly evolved terminin to bind chromosome ends in a sequence-independent manner. This hypothesis suggests that terminin is the functional analog of the shelterin complex that protects human telomeres. The non-terminin proteins are instead likely to correspond to ancestral telomere-associated proteins that did not evolve as rapidly as terminin because of the functional constraints imposed by their involvement in diverse cellular processes. Thus, it appears that the main difference between Drosophila and human telomeres is in the protective complexes that specifically associate with the {DNA} termini. We believe that Drosophila telomeres offer excellent opportunities for investigations on human telomere biology. The identification of additional Drosophila genes encoding non-terminin proteins involved in telomere protection might lead to the discovery of novel components of human telomeres.},

Here we present a new generation of {mMass}, a cross-platform environment for the precise analysis of individual mass spectra. The software covers a wide range of processing tasks such as import from various data formats, smoothing, baseline correction, peak picking, deisotoping, charge determination, and recalibration.

A specific tool is available for isotopic pattern modeling to enable precise data validation. The largest available lipid database (from the {LIPID} {MAPS} Consortium) has been incorporated and together with the new compound search tool lipids can be rapidly identified. In addition, the user can define custom libraries of compounds and use them analogously. The new version of {mMass} is based on a stand-alone Python library, which provides the basic functionality for data processing and interpretation. This library can serve as a good starting point for other developers in their projects.

	abstract = {Human telomere length is controlled by a negative feedback loop based on the binding of {TRF1} to double-stranded telomeric {DNA.} The {TRF1} complex recruits {POT1}, a single-stranded telomeric {DNA-binding} protein necessary for cis-inhibition of telomerase. By mass spectrometry, we have identified a new telomeric protein, which we have named {POT1-interacting} protein 1 {(PIP1).} {PIP1} bound both {POT1} and the {TRF1-interacting} factor {TIN2} and could tether {POT1} to the {TRF1} complex. Reduction of {PIP1} or {POT1} levels with {shRNAs} led to telomere elongation, indicating that {PIP1} contributes to telomere length control through recruitment of {POT1.}},
