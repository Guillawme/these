	abstract = {Summary
The termini of linear chromosomes are protected by specialized {DNA} structures known as telomeres that also facilitate the complete replication of {DNA} ends. The simplest type of telomere is a covalently closed {DNA} hairpin structure found in linear chromosomes of prokaryotes and viruses. Bidirectional replication of a chromosome with hairpin telomeres produces a catenated circular dimer that is subsequently resolved into unit-length chromosomes by a dedicated {DNA} cleavage-rejoining enzyme known as a hairpin telomere resolvase (protelomerase). Here we report a crystal structure of the protelomerase {TelK} from Klebsiella oxytoca phage {$\phi$KO2}, in complex with the palindromic target {DNA.} The structure shows the {TelK} dimer destabilizes base pairing interactions to promote the refolding of cleaved {DNA} ends into two hairpin ends. We propose that the hairpinning reaction is made effectively irreversible by a unique protein-induced distortion of the {DNA} substrate that prevents religation of the cleaved {DNA} substrate.},

	abstract = {Genomes can be organised in different ways. Understanding the extent of the diversity of genome organisation, the processes that create it, and its consequences is particularly important for two key reasons. Firstly, it is relevant for our understanding of the genetic basis for the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Elucidating the mechanisms and processes underlying such diversity has been, and remains, one of the central goals of biological research. Secondly, it helps prepare us for our analysis of new genomes. For example, knowing that plasmids can be circular or linear, we know to check for circularity or linearity in a plasmid we encounter for the first time (if this is relevant for our analysis). This article provides an overview of variation and diversity in several aspects of genome organisation and architecture, including the number, size, ploidy, composition {(RNA} or {DNA)}, packaging, and topology of the molecules encoding the genome. Additionally, it reviews differences in selected genomic features, i.e. telomeres, centromeres, {DNA} replication origins, and sex chromosomes. To put this in context, it incorporates a brief survey of organism diversity and the tree of life, and ends with a discussion of mutation mechanisms and inheritance, and explanations of key terms used to describe genomic variation.},

The genomes of Borrelia species can be composed of up to 24 {DNA} molecules, most of which are linear. The plasmid content and linear replicon sequence arrangement vary widely between isolates. The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed {DNA} hairpins or hairpin telomeres. Replication of these elements involves a unique reaction, called telomere resolution, to produce hairpin telomeres from replicative intermediates. The telomere resolvase, {ResT}, is thought to contribute to the genetic flux of the linear molecules by promoting stabilized telomere fusions. Telomere resolvases are related to the tyrosine recombinases and {ResT} can generate the crucial reaction intermediate of this class of enzyme, the Holliday junction. This observation has led to the proposal that telomere resolvases evolved from tyrosine recombinases inducing {DNA} linearization in the genomes that acquired them.},

Replication initiation systems found on different linear Streptomyces plasmids consist of helicase-like genes and iterons of relatively diverse origins. In contrast, the end patching system (including the telomeres and the {TPs)} is highly conserved in most linear replicons in Streptomyces with only a single exception so far. Both the {TPs} and the telomeric {DNAs} have evolved structural features to serve replication as well as protection of the telomeres. Interaction of {TPs} shapes the linear replicon into a circular form, which would allow generation of biologically important superhelicity in terminal {DNA}, but would also create complications during postreplicational segregation of the daughter {DNA.} {TPs} may also be involved in priming initiation of replication during conjugal transfer. Like the {T-DNA} transfer system in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the {TPs} can target themselves and the attached {DNA} into eukaryotic nuclei, thus suggesting a possibility of interkingdom conjugal transfer.},

Rap1 mediates silencing at the {HM} loci and at telomeres by recruiting the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins to chromatin via a Rap1 C-terminal domain, which also recruits the telomere length regulators, Rif1 and Rif2. We report the 1.85 A resolution crystal structure of the Rap1 C-terminus, which adopts an all-helical fold with no structural homologues. The structure was used to engineer surface mutations in Rap1, and the effects of these mutations on silencing and telomere length regulation were assayed in vivo. Our surprising finding was that there is no overlap between mutations affecting mating-type and telomeric silencing, suggesting that Rap1 plays distinct roles in silencing at the silent mating-type loci and telomeres. We also found novel Rap1 phenotypes and new separation-of-function mutants, which provide new tools for studying Rap1 function. Yeast two-hybrid studies were used to determine how specific mutations affect recruitment of Sir3, Rif1, and Rif2. A comparison of the yeast two-hybrid and functional data reveals patterns of protein interactions that correlate with each Rap1 phenotype. We find that Sir3 interactions are important for telomeric silencing, but not mating type silencing, and that Rif1 and Rif2 interactions are important in different subsets of telomeric length mutants. Our results show that the role of Rap1 in silencing differs between the {HM} loci and the telomeres and offer insight into the interplay between {HM} silencing, telomeric silencing, and telomere length regulation. These findings suggest a model in which competition and multiple recruitment events modulate silencing and telomere length regulation.},

The telomeres of its unusual linear chromosome are covalently closed hairpins. The circular and linear chromosomes co-segregate and are stably maintained in the organism. We have determined the sequence of the two ends of the linear chromosome thus completing the previously published genome sequence of A. tumefaciens C58. We found that the telomeres carry nearly identical 25-bp sequences at the hairpin ends that are related by dyad symmetry. We further showed that its Atu2523 gene encodes a protelomerase (resolvase) and that the purified enzyme can generate the linear chromosomal closed hairpin ends in a sequence-specific manner. Agrobacterium protelomerase, whose presence is apparently limited to biovar 1 strains, acts via a cleavage-and-religation mechanism by making a pair of transient staggered nicks invariably at 6-bp spacing as the reaction intermediate. The enzyme can be significantly shortened at both the N and C termini and still maintain its enzymatic activity. Although the full-length enzyme can uniquely bind to its product telomeres, the N-terminal truncations cannot. The target site can also be shortened from the native 50-bp inverted repeat to 26 bp; thus, the Agrobacterium hairpin-generating system represents the most compact activity of all hairpin linear chromosome- and plasmid-generating systems to date. The biochemical analyses of the protelomerase reactions further revealed that the tip of the hairpin telomere may be unusually polymorphically capable of accommodating any nucleotide.},

	abstract = {Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of the linear eukaryotic chromosomes and thereby protect their stability and integrity. Telomeres play central roles in maintaining the genome's integrity, distinguishing between the natural chromosomal ends and unwanted double-stranded breaks. In addition, telomeres are replicated by a special reverse transcriptase called telomerase, in a complex mechanism that is coordinated with the genome's replication. Telomeres also play an important role in tethering the chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, thus helping in positioning the chromosomes within the nucleus. The special chromatin configuration of telomeres affects the expression of nearby genes; nonetheless, telomeres are transcribed, creating noncoding {RNA} molecules that hybridize to the chromosomal ends and seem to play regulatory roles. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with its sophisticated genetics and molecular biology, has provided many fundamental concepts in telomere biology, which were later found to be conserved in all organisms. Here, we present an overview of all the aspects of telomere biology investigated in yeast, which continues to provide new insights into this complex and important subject, which has significant medical implications, especially in the fields of aging and cancer.},

	abstract = {We have devised a high-resolution protein footprinting methodology to dissect {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase {(RT)} contacts to the viral {RNA:tRNA} complex. The experimental strategy included modification of surface-exposed lysines in {RT} and {RT-viral} {RNA:tRNA} complexes by the primary amine selective reagent {NHS-biotin}, {SDS/PAGE} separation of p66 and p51 polypeptides, in gel proteolysis, and comparative mass spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments. The lysines modified in free {RT} but protected from biotinylation in the nucleoprotein complex were readily revealed by this approach. Results of a control experiment examining the {RT-DNA:DNA} complex were in excellent agreement with the crystal structure data on the identical complex. Probing the {RT-viral} {RNA:tRNA} complex revealed that a majority of protein contacts are located in the primer-template binding cleft in common with the {RT-DNA:DNA} and {RT-RNA:DNA} species. However, our footprinting data indicate that the p66 fingers subdomain makes additional contacts to the viral {RNA:tRNA} specific for this complex and not detected with {DNA:DNA.} The protein footprinting method described herein has a generic application for high-resolution solution structural studies of multiprotein-nucleic acid contacts.},

In this work, we used the {telN/tos} system of bacteriophage N1 to show that the circular genome of Escherichia coli can be split into two linear chromosomes that complement each other to produce viable cells.},

	abstract = {The rapid evolution of telomere proteins has hindered identification of orthologs from diverse species and created the impression that certain groups of eukaryotes have largely non-overlapping sets of telomere proteins. However, the recent identification of additional telomere proteins from various model organisms has dispelled this notion by expanding our understanding of the composition, architecture and range of telomere protein complexes present in individual species. It is now apparent that versions of the budding yeast {CST} complex and mammalian shelterin are present in multiple phyla. While the precise subunit composition and architecture of these complexes vary between species, the general function is often conserved. Despite the overall conservation of telomere protein complexes, there is still considerable species-specific variation, with some organisms having lost a particular subunit or even an entire complex. In some cases, complex components appear to have migrated between the telomere and the telomerase {RNP.} Finally, gene duplication has created telomere protein paralogs with novel functions. While one paralog may be part of a conserved telomere protein complex and have the expected function, the other paralog may serve in a completely different aspect of telomere biology.},

	abstract = {For many years, amino acid-specific covalent labeling has been a valuable tool to study protein structure and protein interactions, especially for systems that are difficult to study by other means. These covalent labeling methods typically map protein structure and interactions by measuring the differential reactivity of amino acid side chains. The reactivity of amino acids in proteins generally depends on the accessibility of the side chain to the reagent, the inherent reactivity of the label and the reactivity of the amino acid side chain. Peptide mass mapping with {ESI-} or {MALDI-MS} and peptide sequencing with tandem {MS} are typically employed to identify modification sites to provide site-specific structural information. In this review, we describe the reagents that are most commonly used in these residue-specific modification reactions, details about the proper use of these covalent labeling reagents, and information about the specific biochemical problems that have been addressed with covalent labeling strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 28:785{\textendash}815, 2009},

Since 1985, telomerase has been studied intensively and components of the telomerase complex have been identified from over 160 eukaryotic species. In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in studying telomerase owing to its vital role in chromosome stability and cellular immortality. To keep up with the remarkable explosion of knowledge about telomerase, we compiled information related to telomerase in an exhaustive database called the Telomerase Database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/). The Telomerase Database provides comprehensive information about (i) sequences of the {RNA} and protein subunits of telomerase, (ii) sequence alignments based on the phylogenetic relationship and structure, (iii) secondary structures of the {RNA} component and tertiary structures of various subunits of telomerase, (iv) mutations of telomerase components found in human patients and (v) active researchers who contributed to the wealth of current knowledge on telomerase. The information is hierarchically organized by the components, i.e. the telomerase reverse transcriptase {(TERT)}, telomerase {RNA} {(TR)} and other telomerase-associated proteins. The Telomerase Database is a useful resource especially for researchers who are interested in investigating the structure, function, evolution and medical relevance of the telomerase enzyme.},

	doi = {10.3389/fonc.2013.00112},
	abstract = {Drosophila lacks telomerase and fly telomeres are elongated by occasional transposition of three specialized retroelements. Drosophila telomeres do not terminate with {GC-rich} repeats and are assembled independently of the sequence of chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that Drosophila telomeres are capped by the terminin complex, which includes the fast-evolving proteins {HOAP}, {HipHop}, Moi, and Ver. These proteins, which are not conserved outside Drosophilidae and closely related Diptera, localize and function exclusively at telomeres, protecting them from fusion events. Other proteins required to prevent end-to-end fusion in flies include {HP1}, {Eff/UbcD1}, {ATM}, the components of the {Mre11-Rad50-Nbs} {(MRN)} complex, and the Woc transcription factor. These proteins do not share the terminin properties; they are evolutionarily conserved non-fast-evolving proteins that do not accumulate only at telomeres and do not serve telomere-specific functions. We propose that following telomerase loss, Drosophila rapidly evolved terminin to bind chromosome ends in a sequence-independent manner. This hypothesis suggests that terminin is the functional analog of the shelterin complex that protects human telomeres. The non-terminin proteins are instead likely to correspond to ancestral telomere-associated proteins that did not evolve as rapidly as terminin because of the functional constraints imposed by their involvement in diverse cellular processes. Thus, it appears that the main difference between Drosophila and human telomeres is in the protective complexes that specifically associate with the {DNA} termini. We believe that Drosophila telomeres offer excellent opportunities for investigations on human telomere biology. The identification of additional Drosophila genes encoding non-terminin proteins involved in telomere protection might lead to the discovery of novel components of human telomeres.},

Current software support is mostly provided only by the instrument vendors, and the available software tools are often instrument-dependent. Here we present a new generation of {mMass}, a cross-platform environment for the precise analysis of individual mass spectra. The software covers a wide range of processing tasks such as import from various data formats, smoothing, baseline correction, peak picking, deisotoping, charge determination, and recalibration. Functions presented in the earlier versions such as in silico digestion and fragmentation were redesigned and improved. In addition to Mascot, an interface for {ProFound} has been implemented. A specific tool is available for isotopic pattern modeling to enable precise data validation. The largest available lipid database (from the {LIPID} {MAPS} Consortium) has been incorporated and together with the new compound search tool lipids can be rapidly identified. In addition, the user can define custom libraries of compounds and use them analogously. The new version of {mMass} is based on a stand-alone Python library, which provides the basic functionality for data processing and interpretation. This library can serve as a good starting point for other developers in their projects. Binary distributions of {mMass}, its source code, a detailed user?s guide, and video tutorials are freely available from www.mmass.org .},
