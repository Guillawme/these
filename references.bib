	abstract = {Telomeres can fold into t-loops that may result from the invasion of the 3' overhang into duplex {DNA.} Their formation is facilitated in vitro by the telomeric protein {TRF2}, but very little is known regarding the mechanisms involved. Here we reveal that {TRF2} generates positive supercoiling and condenses {DNA.} Using a variety of {TRF2} mutants, we demonstrate a strong correlation between this topological activity and the ability to stimulate strand invasion. We also report that these properties require the combination of the {TRF-homology} {(TRFH)} domain of {TRF2} with either its N- or C-terminal {DNA-binding} domains. We propose that {TRF2} complexes, by constraining {DNA} around themselves in a right-handed conformation, can induce untwisting of the neighboring {DNA}, thereby favoring strand invasion. Implications of this topological model in t-loop formation and telomere homeostasis are discussed.},

	abstract = {The replication of the ends of linear chromosomes, or telomeres, poses unique problems, which must be solved to maintain genome integrity and to allow cell division to occur. Here, we describe and compare the timing and specific mechanisms that are required to initiate, control and coordinate synthesis of the leading and lagging strands at telomeres in yeasts, ciliates and mammals. Overall, it emerges that telomere replication relies on a strong synergy between the conventional replication machinery, telomere protection systems, {DNA-damage-response} pathways and chromosomal organization.},
