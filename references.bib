	abstract = {Summary
The termini of linear chromosomes are protected by specialized {DNA} structures known as telomeres that also facilitate the complete replication of {DNA} ends. The simplest type of telomere is a covalently closed {DNA} hairpin structure found in linear chromosomes of prokaryotes and viruses. Bidirectional replication of a chromosome with hairpin telomeres produces a catenated circular dimer that is subsequently resolved into unit-length chromosomes by a dedicated {DNA} cleavage-rejoining enzyme known as a hairpin telomere resolvase (protelomerase). Here we report a crystal structure of the protelomerase {TelK} from Klebsiella oxytoca phage {$\phi$KO2}, in complex with the palindromic target {DNA.} The structure shows the {TelK} dimer destabilizes base pairing interactions to promote the refolding of cleaved {DNA} ends into two hairpin ends. We propose that the hairpinning reaction is made effectively irreversible by a unique protein-induced distortion of the {DNA} substrate that prevents religation of the cleaved {DNA} substrate.},

	abstract = {Genomes can be organised in different ways. Understanding the extent of the diversity of genome organisation, the processes that create it, and its consequences is particularly important for two key reasons. Firstly, it is relevant for our understanding of the genetic basis for the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Elucidating the mechanisms and processes underlying such diversity has been, and remains, one of the central goals of biological research. Secondly, it helps prepare us for our analysis of new genomes. For example, knowing that plasmids can be circular or linear, we know to check for circularity or linearity in a plasmid we encounter for the first time (if this is relevant for our analysis). This article provides an overview of variation and diversity in several aspects of genome organisation and architecture, including the number, size, ploidy, composition {(RNA} or {DNA)}, packaging, and topology of the molecules encoding the genome. Additionally, it reviews differences in selected genomic features, i.e. telomeres, centromeres, {DNA} replication origins, and sex chromosomes. To put this in context, it incorporates a brief survey of organism diversity and the tree of life, and ends with a discussion of mutation mechanisms and inheritance, and explanations of key terms used to describe genomic variation.},

	abstract = {Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia include important human pathogens that cause Lyme borreliosis and relapsing fever. The genomes of Borrelia species can be composed of up to 24 {DNA} molecules, most of which are linear. The plasmid content and linear replicon sequence arrangement vary widely between isolates. The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed {DNA} hairpins or hairpin telomeres. Replication of these elements involves a unique reaction, called telomere resolution, to produce hairpin telomeres from replicative intermediates. The telomere resolvase, {ResT}, is thought to contribute to the genetic flux of the linear molecules by promoting stabilized telomere fusions. Telomere resolvases are related to the tyrosine recombinases and {ResT} can generate the crucial reaction intermediate of this class of enzyme, the Holliday junction. This observation has led to the proposal that telomere resolvases evolved from tyrosine recombinases inducing {DNA} linearization in the genomes that acquired them.},

An unusual feature of these bacteria is a genome that includes linear {DNA} molecules with covalently closed hairpin ends referred to as telomeres. We have investigated the mechanism by which the hairpin telomeres are processed during replication. A synthetic 140 bp sequence having the predicted structure of a replicated telomere was shown to function as a viable substrate for telomere resolution in vivo, and was sufficient to convert a circular replicon to a linear form. Our results suggest that the final step in the replication of linear Borrelia replicons is a site-specific {DNA} breakage and reunion event to regenerate covalently closed hairpin ends. The telomere substrate described here will be valuable both for in vivo manipulation of linear {DNA} in Borrelia and for in vitro studies to identify and characterize the telomere resolvase.},

To explore the effects of possessing a linear genome on prokaryotic cells, we linearized the Escherichia coli genome using the lysogenic $\lambda$-like phage N15. Linear genome E. coli were viable and their genome structure was stable. There were no appreciable differences between cells with linear or circular genomes in growth rates, cell and nucleoid morphologies, genome-wide gene expression (with a few exceptions), and {DNA} gyrase- and topoisomerase {IV-dependent} growth. However, under dif-defective conditions, only cells with a circular genome developed an abnormal phenotype.

	abstract = {Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, the pathogenic bacteria that causes crown gall disease in plants, harbors one circular and one linear chromosome and two circular plasmids. The telomeres of its unusual linear chromosome are covalently closed hairpins. The circular and linear chromosomes co-segregate and are stably maintained in the organism. We have determined the sequence of the two ends of the linear chromosome thus completing the previously published genome sequence of A. tumefaciens C58. We found that the telomeres carry nearly identical 25-bp sequences at the hairpin ends that are related by dyad symmetry. We further showed that its Atu2523 gene encodes a protelomerase (resolvase) and that the purified enzyme can generate the linear chromosomal closed hairpin ends in a sequence-specific manner. Agrobacterium protelomerase, whose presence is apparently limited to biovar 1 strains, acts via a cleavage-and-religation mechanism by making a pair of transient staggered nicks invariably at 6-bp spacing as the reaction intermediate. The enzyme can be significantly shortened at both the N and C termini and still maintain its enzymatic activity. Although the full-length enzyme can uniquely bind to its product telomeres, the N-terminal truncations cannot. The target site can also be shortened from the native 50-bp inverted repeat to 26 bp; thus, the Agrobacterium hairpin-generating system represents the most compact activity of all hairpin linear chromosome- and plasmid-generating systems to date. The biochemical analyses of the protelomerase reactions further revealed that the tip of the hairpin telomere may be unusually polymorphically capable of accommodating any nucleotide.},

	abstract = {The sequence organisation of the telomeric regions is extremely similar for all eukaryotes examined to date. Subtelomeric areas may contain large sequence arrays of middle repetitive, complex elements that sometimes have similarities to retrotransposons. In between and within these complex sequences are short, satellite-like repeats. These areas contain very few genes and are thought to be organised into a heterochromatin-like domain. The terminal regions almost invariably consist of short, direct repeats. These repeats usually contain clusters of 2-4 G residues and the strand that contains these clusters (the G strand) always forms the extreme 3'-end of the chromosome. Thus, most telomeric repeats are clearly related to each other which in turn suggests a common evolutionary origin. A number of different structures can be formed by single-stranded telomeric G strand repeats and, as has been suggested recently, by the G strand. Since the main mechanism for the maintenance of telomeric repeats predicts the occurrence of single-stranded extensions of the G strand, the propensity of G-rich {DNA} to fold into alternative {DNA} structures may have implications for telomere biology.},
