	abstract = {Summary
The termini of linear chromosomes are protected by specialized {DNA} structures known as telomeres that also facilitate the complete replication of {DNA} ends. The simplest type of telomere is a covalently closed {DNA} hairpin structure found in linear chromosomes of prokaryotes and viruses. Bidirectional replication of a chromosome with hairpin telomeres produces a catenated circular dimer that is subsequently resolved into unit-length chromosomes by a dedicated {DNA} cleavage-rejoining enzyme known as a hairpin telomere resolvase (protelomerase). Here we report a crystal structure of the protelomerase {TelK} from Klebsiella oxytoca phage {$\phi$KO2}, in complex with the palindromic target {DNA.} The structure shows the {TelK} dimer destabilizes base pairing interactions to promote the refolding of cleaved {DNA} ends into two hairpin ends. We propose that the hairpinning reaction is made effectively irreversible by a unique protein-induced distortion of the {DNA} substrate that prevents religation of the cleaved {DNA} substrate.},

We also report that these properties require the combination of the {TRF-homology} {(TRFH)} domain of {TRF2} with either its N- or C-terminal {DNA-binding} domains. We propose that {TRF2} complexes, by constraining {DNA} around themselves in a right-handed conformation, can induce untwisting of the neighboring {DNA}, thereby favoring strand invasion.

Inhibition of telomerase activity by a modified oligonucleotide did not further increase the pace of telomere erosion caused by {TRF1} targeting, suggesting that telomerase itself is the target of {TRF1} regulation.

Instead, a tandem array of 12 telomeric repeats is sufficient to impede illegitimate repair in a highly directional manner at nearby {DNA} ends. The polarity of end protection is consistent with the orientation of naturally occurring telomeres and is well suited to minimize interference between chromosome capping and the repair of {DNA} double-strand breaks in subtelomeric sequences.

Antibodies directed against the Tbf1 telobox detect two proteins in nuclear and mitotic chromosome extracts from human cell lines.

Some hybrid clones subsequently recommenced proliferation and became immortalized either with or without telomerase activity. Those without telomerase activity also had very long and heterogeneous telomeres.

Understanding the extent of the diversity of genome organisation, the processes that create it, and its consequences is particularly important for two key reasons. Firstly, it is relevant for our understanding of the genetic basis for the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Elucidating the mechanisms and processes underlying such diversity has been, and remains, one of the central goals of biological research. Secondly, it helps prepare us for our analysis of new genomes. For example, knowing that plasmids can be circular or linear, we know to check for circularity or linearity in a plasmid we encounter for the first time (if this is relevant for our analysis). This article provides an overview of variation and diversity in several aspects of genome organisation and architecture, including the number, size, ploidy, composition {(RNA} or {DNA)}, packaging, and topology of the molecules encoding the genome. Additionally, it reviews differences in selected genomic features, i.e. telomeres, centromeres, {DNA} replication origins, and sex chromosomes. To put this in context, it incorporates a brief survey of organism diversity and the tree of life, and ends with a discussion of mutation mechanisms and inheritance, and explanations of key terms used to describe genomic variation.},

Sequence analysis using hydrophobic cluster analysis reveals here the presence of 50 copies of the {BRCT} domain in 23 different proteins, including, in addition to {BRCA1}, {53BP1} and {RAD9}, {XRCC1}, {RAD4}, Ect2, {REV1}, Crb2, {RAP1}, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferases {(TdT)} and three eukaryotic {DNA} ligases.

	abstract = {Unlimited cellular proliferation depends on counteracting the telomere attrition that accompanies {DNA} replication. In human cancers this usually occurs through upregulation of telomerase activity, but in 10-15\% of cancers - including some with particularly poor outcome - it is achieved through a mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres {(ALT).} {ALT}, which is dependent on homologous recombination, is therefore an important target for cancer therapy. Although dissection of the mechanism or mechanisms of {ALT} has been challenging, recent advances have led to the identification of several genes that are required for {ALT} and the elucidation of the biological significance of some phenotypic markers of {ALT.} This has enabled development of a rapid assay of {ALT} activity levels and the construction of molecular models of {ALT.}},

	abstract = {Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia include important human pathogens that cause Lyme borreliosis and relapsing fever. The genomes of Borrelia species can be composed of up to 24 {DNA} molecules, most of which are linear. The plasmid content and linear replicon sequence arrangement vary widely between isolates. The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed {DNA} hairpins or hairpin telomeres. Replication of these elements involves a unique reaction, called telomere resolution, to produce hairpin telomeres from replicative intermediates. The telomere resolvase, {ResT}, is thought to contribute to the genetic flux of the linear molecules by promoting stabilized telomere fusions. Telomere resolvases are related to the tyrosine recombinases and {ResT} can generate the crucial reaction intermediate of this class of enzyme, the Holliday junction. This observation has led to the proposal that telomere resolvases evolved from tyrosine recombinases inducing {DNA} linearization in the genomes that acquired them.},

Replication initiation systems found on different linear Streptomyces plasmids consist of helicase-like genes and iterons of relatively diverse origins. In contrast, the end patching system (including the telomeres and the {TPs)} is highly conserved in most linear replicons in Streptomyces with only a single exception so far. Both the {TPs} and the telomeric {DNAs} have evolved structural features to serve replication as well as protection of the telomeres. Interaction of {TPs} shapes the linear replicon into a circular form, which would allow generation of biologically important superhelicity in terminal {DNA}, but would also create complications during postreplicational segregation of the daughter {DNA.} {TPs} may also be involved in priming initiation of replication during conjugal transfer. Like the {T-DNA} transfer system in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the {TPs} can target themselves and the attached {DNA} into eukaryotic nuclei, thus suggesting a possibility of interkingdom conjugal transfer.},

Our analysis establishes {RAP1(RCT)} as an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction module. In mammalian and fission yeast cells, this module interacts with {TRF2} and Taz1, respectively, targeting {RAP1} to chromosome ends for telomere protection. In contrast, S. cerevisiae {RAP1} uses its {RCT} domain to recruit Sir3 to telomeres to mediate gene silencing.

Indeed, p67phox is the only factor establishing interaction with all others. In this study, we report the {SAXS} analysis of p67phox. Our data reveals that p67phox behaves as a multidomain protein with semi-flexible linkers. On the one hand, it appears to be a very elongated molecule with its various domains organized as beads on a string. Linkers are predicted to be partially or mainly unstructured and features of our experimental data do point towards inter-domain flexibility. On the other hand, our work also suggests that the protein is not as extended as unstructured linkers could allow, thereby implying the existence of intra-molecular interactions within p67phox.

It covers determination of the point-group symmetry of the diffraction data (the Laue group), which is required for the subsequent scaling step, examination of systematic absences, which in many cases will allow inference of the space group, putting multiple data sets on a common indexing system when there are alternatives, the scaling step itself, which produces a large set of data-quality indicators, estimation of {{\textbar}F{\textbar}} from intensity and finally examination of intensity statistics to detect crystal pathologies such as twinning. An appendix outlines the scoring schemes used by the program {POINTLESS} to assign probabilities to possible Laue and space groups.},

Dimerization involves the {TRF} homology {(TRFH)} domain, which also mediates interactions with other telomeric proteins. The crystal structures of the dimerization domains from human {TRF1} and {TRF2} were determined at 2.9 and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. Despite a modest sequence identity, the two {TRFH} domains have the same entirely alpha-helical architecture, resembling a twisted horseshoe. The dimerization interfaces feature unique interactions that prevent heterodimerization. Mutational analysis of {TRF1} corroborates the structural data and underscores the importance of the {TRFH} domain in dimerization, {DNA} binding, and telomere localization. A possible structural homology between the {TRFH} domain of fission yeast telomeric protein Taz1 with those of the vertebrate {TRFs} is suggested.},

	abstract = {The yeast Rap1 protein plays an important role in transcriptional silencing and in telomere length homeostasis. Rap1 mediates silencing at the {HM} loci and at telomeres by recruiting the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins to chromatin via a Rap1 C-terminal domain, which also recruits the telomere length regulators, Rif1 and Rif2. We report the 1.85 A resolution crystal structure of the Rap1 C-terminus, which adopts an all-helical fold with no structural homologues. The structure was used to engineer surface mutations in Rap1, and the effects of these mutations on silencing and telomere length regulation were assayed in vivo. Our surprising finding was that there is no overlap between mutations affecting mating-type and telomeric silencing, suggesting that Rap1 plays distinct roles in silencing at the silent mating-type loci and telomeres. We also found novel Rap1 phenotypes and new separation-of-function mutants, which provide new tools for studying Rap1 function. Yeast two-hybrid studies were used to determine how specific mutations affect recruitment of Sir3, Rif1, and Rif2. A comparison of the yeast two-hybrid and functional data reveals patterns of protein interactions that correlate with each Rap1 phenotype. We find that Sir3 interactions are important for telomeric silencing, but not mating type silencing, and that Rif1 and Rif2 interactions are important in different subsets of telomeric length mutants. Our results show that the role of Rap1 in silencing differs between the {HM} loci and the telomeres and offer insight into the interplay between {HM} silencing, telomeric silencing, and telomere length regulation. These findings suggest a model in which competition and multiple recruitment events modulate silencing and telomere length regulation.},

	abstract = {Ku is an abundant, highly conserved {DNA} binding protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that plays essential roles in the maintenance of genome integrity. In eukaryotes, Ku is a heterodimer comprised of two subunits, Ku70 and Ku80, that is best characterized for its central role as the initial {DNA} end binding factor in the {\textquotedblleft}classical{\textquotedblright} non-homologous end joining {(C-NHEJ)} pathway, the main {DNA} double-strand break {(DSB)} repair pathway in mammals. Ku binds double-stranded {DNA} ends with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner through a central ring formed by the intertwined strands of the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits. At the break, Ku directly and indirectly interacts with several {C-NHEJ} factors and processing enzymes, serving as the scaffold for the entire {DNA} repair complex. There is also evidence that Ku is involved in signaling to the {DNA} damage response {(DDR)} machinery to modulate the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the activation of apoptosis. Interestingly, Ku is also associated with telomeres, where, paradoxically to its {DNA} end-joining functions, it protects the telomere ends from being recognized as {DSBs}, thereby preventing their recombination and degradation. Ku, together with the silent information regulator {(Sir)} complex is also required for transcriptional silencing through telomere position effect {(TPE).} How Ku associates with telomeres, whether it is through direct {DNA} binding, or through protein{\textendash}protein interactions with other telomere bound factors remains to be determined. Ku is central to the protection of organisms through its participation in {C-NHEJ} to repair {DSBs} generated during {V(D)J} recombination, a process that is indispensable for the establishment of the immune response. Ku also functions to prevent tumorigenesis and senescence since Ku-deficient mice show increased cancer incidence and early onset of aging. Overall, Ku function is critical to the maintenance of genomic integrity and to proper cellular and organismal development.},

Telomere length deregulation and telomerase activation is an early, and perhaps necessary, step in cancer cell evolution. Here we present the high-resolution structure of the Tribolium castaneum catalytic subunit of telomerase, {TERT.} The protein consists of three highly conserved domains, organized into a ring-like structure that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral {RNA} polymerases and B-family {DNA} polymerases. Domain organization places motifs implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the interior of the ring, which can accommodate seven to eight bases of double-stranded nucleic acid. Modelling of an {RNA{\textendash}DNA} heteroduplex in the interior of this ring demonstrates a perfect fit between the protein and the nucleic acid substrate, and positions the 3'-end of the {DNA} primer at the active site of the enzyme, providing evidence for the formation of an active telomerase elongation complex.},

It emerges that telomeres are formed by a complex and specific network of interactions between {DNA}, {RNA}, and proteins. The fact that these interactions and associated activities are reinforcing each other might help to guarantee the robustness of telomeric functions across the cell cycle and in the event of cellular perturbations. We will also discuss the recent notion that telomeres have evolved specific systems to overcome the {DNA} topological stress generated during their replication and transcription.

Recently, the human ortholog of {scRap1p} {(hRap1)} was identified and shown to contain a {BRCT} domain and an {RCT} domain similar to {scRap1p.} However, {hRap1} contained only one recognizable Myb motif in the center of the protein. Furthermore, while {scRap1p} binds telomeric {DNA} directly, {hRap1} has no {DNA-binding} ability. Instead, {hRap1} is tethered to telomeres by {TRF2.} Here, we have determined the solution structure of the Myb domain of {hRap1} by {NMR.} It contains three helices maintained by a hydrophobic core. The architecture of the {hRap1} Myb domain is very close to that of each of the Myb domains from {TRF1}, {scRap1p} and {c-Myb.} However, the electrostatic potential surface of the {hRap1} Myb domain is distinguished from that of the other Myb domains.

The {hRap1} Myb domain may be a member of a second class of Myb motifs that lacks {DNA-binding} activity but may interact instead with other proteins. Other possible members of this class are the {c-Myb} R1 Myb domain and the Myb domains of {ADA2} and Adf1.

Human telomeres are coated by the telomere repeat binding proteins {TRF1} and {TRF2}, which are believed to function independently to regulate telomere length and protect chromosome ends, respectively.


{RESULTS}

Here, we show that {TRF1} and {TRF2} are linked via {TIN2}, a previously identified {TRF1-interacting} protein, and its novel binding partner {TINT1.} {TINT1} localized to telomeres via {TIN2}, where it functioned as a negative regulator of telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. {TIN2} associated with {TINT1}, and {TRF1} or {TRF2} throughout the cell cycle, revealing a partially redundant unit in telomeric chromatin that may provide flexibility in telomere length control. Indeed, when {TRF1} was removed from telomeres by overexpression of the positive telomere length regulator tankyrase 1, the {TIN2/TINT1} complex remained on telomeres via an increased association with {TRF2.}


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our findings suggest a dynamic cross talk between {TRF1} and {TRF2} and provide a molecular mechanism for telomere length homeostasis by {TRF2} in the absence of {TRF1.}},

The telomeres of its unusual linear chromosome are covalently closed hairpins. The circular and linear chromosomes co-segregate and are stably maintained in the organism. We have determined the sequence of the two ends of the linear chromosome thus completing the previously published genome sequence of A. tumefaciens C58. We found that the telomeres carry nearly identical 25-bp sequences at the hairpin ends that are related by dyad symmetry. We further showed that its Atu2523 gene encodes a protelomerase (resolvase) and that the purified enzyme can generate the linear chromosomal closed hairpin ends in a sequence-specific manner. Agrobacterium protelomerase, whose presence is apparently limited to biovar 1 strains, acts via a cleavage-and-religation mechanism by making a pair of transient staggered nicks invariably at 6-bp spacing as the reaction intermediate. The enzyme can be significantly shortened at both the N and C termini and still maintain its enzymatic activity. Although the full-length enzyme can uniquely bind to its product telomeres, the N-terminal truncations cannot. The target site can also be shortened from the native 50-bp inverted repeat to 26 bp; thus, the Agrobacterium hairpin-generating system represents the most compact activity of all hairpin linear chromosome- and plasmid-generating systems to date. The biochemical analyses of the protelomerase reactions further revealed that the tip of the hairpin telomere may be unusually polymorphically capable of accommodating any nucleotide.},

The conserved protein Rap1 functions at telomeres in fungi, protozoa, and vertebrates. Like yeast Rap1, human Rap1 has been implicated in telomere length regulation and repression of nonhomologous end-joining {(NHEJ)} at telomeres. However, mouse telomeres lacking Rap1 do not succumb to {NHEJ.} To determine the functions of human Rap1, we~generated several transcription activator-like effector nuclease {(TALEN)-mediated} human cell lines lacking Rap1. Loss of Rap1 did not affect the other components of shelterin, the modification of telomeric histones, the subnuclear position of telomeres, or the 3' telomeric overhang. Telomeres lacking Rap1 did not show a {DNA} damage response, {NHEJ}, or consistent changes in their length, indicating that Rap1 does not have an important function in protection or length regulation of human telomeres. As human Rap1, like its mouse and unicellular orthologs, affects gene expression, we propose that the conservation of Rap1 reflects its role in transcriptional regulation rather than a function at telomeres.},

Comparison of mammalian Rap1 to the Rap1 proteins of several budding yeasts and fission yeast reveal both striking similarities and notable differences. The protean nature of Rap1 is best understood by viewing it as an adaptor that can mediate a variety of protein-protein and {protein-DNA} interactions depending on the organism and the complex in which it is functioning.},

Telomeres play central roles in maintaining the genome's integrity, distinguishing between the natural chromosomal ends and unwanted double-stranded breaks. In addition, telomeres are replicated by a special reverse transcriptase called telomerase, in a complex mechanism that is coordinated with the genome's replication. Telomeres also play an important role in tethering the chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, thus helping in positioning the chromosomes within the nucleus. The special chromatin configuration of telomeres affects the expression of nearby genes; nonetheless, telomeres are transcribed, creating noncoding {RNA} molecules that hybridize to the chromosomal ends and seem to play regulatory roles. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with its sophisticated genetics and molecular biology, has provided many fundamental concepts in telomere biology, which were later found to be conserved in all organisms. Here, we present an overview of all the aspects of telomere biology investigated in yeast, which continues to provide new insights into this complex and important subject, which has significant medical implications, especially in the fields of aging and cancer.},

However, anomalous data collected at the Mn edge using a {Rap1-DNA} crystal soaked in potassium permanganate solution indicated that the {DNA} conformation in the crystal was compatible with interaction with permanganate ions. Sequence-conservation analysis revealed that {double-Myb-containing} Rap1 proteins all carry a fully conserved Arg580 at a position that may favour interaction with permanganate ions, although it is not involved in the hypersensitive cytosine distortion. Permanganate reactivity assays with wild-type Rap1 and the {Rap1[R580A]} mutant demonstrated that Arg580 is essential for hypersensitivity. {AFM} experiments showed that wild-type Rap1 and the {Rap1[R580A]} mutant interact with {DNA} over 16 successive binding sites, leading to local {DNA} stiffening but not to accumulation of the observed local distortion. Therefore, Rap1 may cause permanganate hypersensitivity of {DNA} by forming a pocket between the reactive cytosine and Arg580, driving the permanganate ion towards the {C5-C6} bond of the cytosine.},

	abstract = {Summary
A major issue in telomere research is to understand how the integrity of chromosome ends is preserved [1, 2]. The human telomeric protein {TRF2} coordinates several pathways that prevent checkpoint activation and chromosome fusions [3{\textendash}9]. In this work, we identified {hSNM1B} [10], here named Apollo, as a novel {TRF2-interacting} factor. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of Apollo is closely related to that of Artemis, a factor involved in {V(D)J} recombination and {DNA} repair [11]. Both proteins belong to the {$\beta$-CASP} metallo-$\beta$-lactamase family of {DNA} caretaker proteins [12, 13]. Apollo appears preferentially localized at telomeres in a {TRF2-dependent} manner. Reduced levels of Apollo exacerbate the sensitivity of cells to {TRF2} inhibition, resulting in severe growth defects and an increased number of telomere-induced {DNA-damage} foci and telomere fusions.

Here, we describe a human protein, {hRap1}, that is an ortholog of the yeast telomeric protein, {scRap1p.} {hRap1} has three conserved sequence motifs in common with {scRap1}, is located at telomeres, and affects telomere length. However, while {scRap1} binds telomeric {DNA} directly, {hRap1} is recruited to telomeres by {TRF2.} Extending the comparison of telomeric proteins to fission yeast, we identify S. pombe Taz1 as a {TRF} ortholog, indicating that {TRFs} are conserved at eukaryotic telomeres. The data suggest that ancestral telomeres, like those of vertebrates, contained a {TRF-like} protein as well as Rap1. We propose that budding yeast preserved Rap1 at telomeres but lost the {TRF} component, possibly concomitant with a change in the telomeric repeat sequence.},

	abstract = {Telomere length is controlled in part by cis-acting negative regulators that limit telomere extension by telomerase. In budding yeast, the major telomere length regulator {scRap1} binds to telomeric {DNA} and acts to inhibit telomere elongation in cis. Because the human Rap1 ortholog {hRap1} does not bind to telomeric {DNA} directly but is recruited to telomeres by {TRF2}, we examined its role in telomere length control. The data are consistent with {hRap1} being a negative regulator of telomere length, indicating functional conservation. Deletion mapping confirmed that {hRap1} is tethered to telomeres through interaction of its C terminus with {TRF2.} The telomere length phenotypes of {hRap1} deletion mutants implicated both the {BRCT} and Myb domain as protein interaction domains involved in telomere length regulation. By contrast, {scRap1} binds to telomeres with its Myb domains and uses its C terminus to recruit the telomere length regulators Rif1 and Rif2. Together, our data show that although the role of Rap1 at telomeres has been largely conserved, the domains of Rap1 have undergone extensive functional changes during eukaryotic evolution. Surprisingly, {hRap1} alleles lacking the {BRCT} domain diminished the heterogeneity of human telomeres, indicating that {hRap1} also plays a role in the regulation of telomere length distribution.},

However, the recent identification of additional telomere proteins from various model organisms has dispelled this notion by expanding our understanding of the composition, architecture and range of telomere protein complexes present in individual species. It is now apparent that versions of the budding yeast {CST} complex and mammalian shelterin are present in multiple phyla. While the precise subunit composition and architecture of these complexes vary between species, the general function is often conserved. Despite the overall conservation of telomere protein complexes, there is still considerable species-specific variation, with some organisms having lost a particular subunit or even an entire complex. In some cases, complex components appear to have migrated between the telomere and the telomerase {RNP.} Finally, gene duplication has created telomere protein paralogs with novel functions. While one paralog may be part of a conserved telomere protein complex and have the expected function, the other paralog may serve in a completely different aspect of telomere biology.},

However, whether cross-talk occurs between the {TRF1} and {TRF2} complexes and how the signals from these complexes are integrated for telomere maintenance remain to be elucidated. Through gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that {TRF1} and {TRF2} are in fact subunits of a telomere-associated high molecular weight complex (telosome) that also contains {POT1}, {PTOP}, {RAP1}, and {TIN2.} We demonstrated that the {TRF1-interacting} protein {TIN2} binds {TRF2} directly and in vivo, thereby bridging {TRF2} to {TRF1.} Consistent with this multi-protein telosome model, stripping {TRF1} off the telomeres by expressing tankyrase reduced telomere recruitment of not only {TIN2} but also {TRF2.} These results help to unify previous observations and suggest that telomere maintenance depends on the multi-subunit telosome.},

As the {TRF1} complex binds to the duplex {DNA} of the telomere, it is unclear how it can affect telomerase, which acts on the single-stranded 3' telomeric overhang. Here we show that the {TRF1} complex interacts with a single-stranded telomeric {DNA-binding} protein{\textemdash}protection of telomeres 1 {(POT1){\textemdash}and} that human {POT1} controls telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. The presence of {POT1} on telomeres was diminished when the amount of single-stranded {DNA} was reduced. Furthermore, {POT1} binding was regulated by the {TRF1} complex in response to telomere length. A mutant form of {POT1} lacking the {DNA-binding} domain abrogated {TRF1-mediated} control of telomere length, and induced rapid and extensive telomere elongation. We propose that the interaction between the {TRF1} complex and {POT1} affects the loading of {POT1} on the single-stranded telomeric {DNA}, thus transmitting information about telomere length to the telomere terminus, where telomerase is regulated.},

By analyzing these four types of interaction data, we found that 358 and 199 proteins have more than one type of interaction information in human and mouse cells, respectively. We also developed table browser and {TeloChIP} genome browser to help researchers with better integrated visualization of interaction data from different studies. The current release of {TeloPIN} database includes 1111 {PPI}, eight telomeric protein {ChIP-seq} data sets, 1391 telomere-associated proteins and 183 {TERRA-interacting} proteins from 92 independent studies in mammalian cells.

We have studied by electron microscopy the organization of {DNA} molecules in these chromatin bodies of macronuclei lysed in water at {pH} 9. Proteinase K treatment of lysed macronuclei progressively releases from chromatin bodies many rosettes of {DNA} molecules bound at one or both ends to a central core of protein. With longer treatment with proteinase K, rosettes disappear, leaving individual free {DNA} molecules. We propose that, in the native state, both ends of {DNA} molecules are bound through telomere-binding protein to a central core to form rosettes. Many rosettes, with collapsed {DNA} loops, aggregate to form a chromatin body. Chromatin bodies are believed to dissociate into individual collapsed rosettes to form the granules in the forward zone of the replication band. In the rear zone of the band, the rosettes dissociate, presumably as a result of release of telomere-binding protein, which is preliminary to the replication of the {DNA} molecules.},

Telomere-binding {TRF2} protein inhibits telomere t-loop deletion by blocking Holliday junction {(HJ)} resolvase cleavage activity, but whether {TRF2} also modulates {HJ} displacement at t-loops is unknown. In this study, we used multiplex fluorophore imaging to track the fate of individual strands of {HJ} substrates. We report the novel finding that {TRF2} inhibits {WRN} helicase strand displacement of {HJs} with telomeric repeats in duplex arms, but unwinding of {HJs} with a telomeric center or lacking telomeric sequence is unaffected. These data, together with results using {TRF2} fragments and {TRF2} {HJ} binding assays, indicate that both the {TRF2} B- and Myb domains are required to inhibit {WRN} {HJ} activity. We propose a novel model whereby simultaneous binding of the {TRF2} B-domain to the {HJ} core and the Myb domain to telomeric arms promote and stabilize {HJs} in a stacked arm conformation that is unfavorable for unwinding. Our biochemical study provides a mechanistic basis for the cellular findings that {TRF2} regulates {WRN} activity at telomeres.},

Despite these problems, the linear form of {DNA} is frequently found in viruses, bacteria, eukaryotic nuclei and organelles. The high incidence of linear chromosomes and/or genomes evokes why and how they emerged in evolution. Here we suggest that the primordial terminal structures (telomeres) of linear chromosomes in eukaryotic nuclei were derived from selfish element(s), which caused the linearization of ancestral circular genome. The telomeres were then essential in solving the emerged problems. Molecular fossils of such elements were recently identified in phylogenetically distant genomes and were shown to generate terminal arrays of tandem repeats. These arrays might mediate the formation of higher order structures at chromosomal termini that stabilize the linear chromosomal form by fulfilling essential telomeric functions. {BioEssays} 28: 182{\textendash}190, 2006. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley periodicals, Inc.},

In addition to {TRF2}, we found {DNA} repair proteins Rad50, Mre11, {PARP1} {(poly(ADP-ribose)} polymerase), and {Ku86/Ku70} to be in this telomeric complex. We demonstrated by deletional analysis that {Rad-50/Mre-11} and Ku86 were recruited to {hRap1} independent of {TRF2.} {PARP1}, however, most likely interacted with {hRap1} through {TRF2.} Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous {hRap1} expression by small hairpin interference {RNA} resulted in longer telomeres. In addition, overexpression of full-length and mutant {hRap1} that lacked the {BRCA1} C-terminal domain functioned as dominant negatives and extended telomeres. Deletion of a novel linker domain of {hRap1} (residues 199-223), however, abolished the dominant negative effect of {hRap1} overexpression. These results indicate that {hRap1} negatively regulates telomere length in vivo and suggest that the linker region of {hRap1} may modulate the recruitment of negative regulators of telomere length.},

Previous work has shown that unlike {TRF1}, {TRF2} condenses telomeric, thus creating consequential negative torsion on the adjacent {DNA}, a property that is thought to lead to the stimulation of single-strand invasion and was proposed to favor telomeric {DNA} looping. In this report, we show that these activities, originating from the central {TRFH} domain of {TRF2}, are also displayed by the {TRFH} domain of {TRF1} but are repressed in the full-length protein by the presence of an acidic domain at the N-terminus. Strikingly, a similar repression is observed on {TRF2} through the binding of a {TERRA-like} {RNA} molecule to the N-terminus of {TRF2.} Phylogenetic and biochemical studies suggest that the N-terminal domains of {TRF} proteins originate from a gradual extension of the coding sequences of a duplicated ancestral gene with a consequential progressive alteration of the biochemical properties of these proteins.

Previously, we demonstrated that in Tetrahymena, the telomeric 3' overhang is protected by a three-protein complex composed of Pot1a, Tpt1, and Pat1. Here we show that Tpt1 and Pat1 associate with a fourth protein, Pat2 {(Pot1} associated Tetrahymena 2). Mass spectrometry of proteins copurifying with Pat1 or Tpt1 identified peptides from Pat2, Pot1a, Tpt1, and Pat1. The lack of other proteins copurifying with Pat1 or Tpt1 implies that the overhang is protected by a four-protein {Pot1a-Tpt1-Pat1-Pat2} complex. We verified that Pat2 localizes to telomeres, but we were unable to detect direct binding to telomeric {DNA.} Cells depleted of Pat2 continue to divide, but the telomeres exhibit gradual shortening. The lack of growth arrest indicates that, in contrast to Pot1a and Tpt1, Pat2 is not required for the sequestration of the telomere from the {DNA} repair machinery. Instead, Pat2 is needed to regulate telomere length, most likely by acting in conjunction with Pat1 to allow telomerase access to the telomere.},

	abstract = {Drosophila lacks telomerase and fly telomeres are elongated by occasional transposition of three specialized retroelements. Drosophila telomeres do not terminate with {GC-rich} repeats and are assembled independently of the sequence of chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that Drosophila telomeres are capped by the terminin complex, which includes the fast-evolving proteins {HOAP}, {HipHop}, Moi, and Ver. These proteins, which are not conserved outside Drosophilidae and closely related Diptera, localize and function exclusively at telomeres, protecting them from fusion events. Other proteins required to prevent end-to-end fusion in flies include {HP1}, {Eff/UbcD1}, {ATM}, the components of the {Mre11-Rad50-Nbs} {(MRN)} complex, and the Woc transcription factor. These proteins do not share the terminin properties; they are evolutionarily conserved non-fast-evolving proteins that do not accumulate only at telomeres and do not serve telomere-specific functions. We propose that following telomerase loss, Drosophila rapidly evolved terminin to bind chromosome ends in a sequence-independent manner. This hypothesis suggests that terminin is the functional analog of the shelterin complex that protects human telomeres. The non-terminin proteins are instead likely to correspond to ancestral telomere-associated proteins that did not evolve as rapidly as terminin because of the functional constraints imposed by their involvement in diverse cellular processes. Thus, it appears that the main difference between Drosophila and human telomeres is in the protective complexes that specifically associate with the {DNA} termini. We believe that Drosophila telomeres offer excellent opportunities for investigations on human telomere biology. The identification of additional Drosophila genes encoding non-terminin proteins involved in telomere protection might lead to the discovery of novel components of human telomeres.},

We report here that the {BRCT} domains also recognize phosphopeptides. Oriented peptide library analysis indicated that the {BRCT} domains from {BRCA1}, {MDC1}, {BARD1}, and {DNA} Ligase {IV} preferred distinct phosphoserine-containing peptides. In addition, the interaction between {BRCA1} and the {BRCT} binding motif of {BACH1} was required for {BACH1} checkpoint activity. Furthermore, {BRCT} domains of the yeast {DNA} repair protein Rad9 could bind phosphopeptides, suggesting that the {BRCT} domains represent a class of ancient phosphopeptide-binding modules. Potential targets of {BRCT} domains were identified through data base search. Structural analysis of {BRCA1} {BRCT} repeats also predicted conserved residues that may form the phosphopeptide-binding pocket. Thus, the {BRCT} repeats are a new family of phosphopeptide-binding domains in {DNA} damage responses.},

On expanding these studies in cells, we find that recruitment of {hRAP1} to telomeres prevents chromosome fusions caused by the loss of {TRF2/hRAP1} from chromosome ends despite activation of a {DNA} damage response. These results provide the first evidence that {hRAP1} inhibits {NHEJ} at mammalian telomeres and identify {hRAP1} as a mediator of genome stability.},

	abstract = {While tools for the automated analysis of {MS} and {LC-MS/MS} data are continuously improving, it is still often the case that at the end of an experiment, the mass spectrometrist will spend time carefully examining individual spectra. Current software support is mostly provided only by the instrument vendors, and the available software tools are often instrument-dependent. Here we present a new generation of {mMass}, a cross-platform environment for the precise analysis of individual mass spectra. The software covers a wide range of processing tasks such as import from various data formats, smoothing, baseline correction, peak picking, deisotoping, charge determination, and recalibration. Functions presented in the earlier versions such as in silico digestion and fragmentation were redesigned and improved. In addition to Mascot, an interface for {ProFound} has been implemented. A specific tool is available for isotopic pattern modeling to enable precise data validation. The largest available lipid database (from the {LIPID} {MAPS} Consortium) has been incorporated and together with the new compound search tool lipids can be rapidly identified. In addition, the user can define custom libraries of compounds and use them analogously. The new version of {mMass} is based on a stand-alone Python library, which provides the basic functionality for data processing and interpretation. This library can serve as a good starting point for other developers in their projects. Binary distributions of {mMass}, its source code, a detailed user?s guide, and video tutorials are freely available from www.mmass.org .},

We refer to the domain of telomere-associated {DNA} damage factors as a Telomere {Dysfunction-Induced} Focus {(TIF).} The accumulation of {53BP1} on uncapped telomeres was reduced in the presence of the {PI3} kinase inhibitors caffeine and wortmannin, which affect {ATM}, {ATR}, and {DNA-PK.} By contrast, Mre11 {TIFs} were resistant to caffeine, consistent with previous findings on the Mre11 response to ionizing radiation. {A-T} cells had a diminished {53BP1} {TIF} response, indicating that the {ATM} kinase is a major transducer of this pathway. However, in the absence of {ATM}, {TRF2} inhibition still induced {TIFs} and senescence, pointing to a second {ATM-independent} pathway.

	abstract = {Human telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at chromosome ends, consist of tandem arrays of {TTAGGG} repeats bound to specific proteins. In normal human cells, telomeres shorten with successive cell divisions, probably due to the terminal sequence loss that accompanies {DNA} replication. In tumours and immortalized cells, this decline is halted through the activation of telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that extends the telomeric {TTAGGG-repeat} arrays. Telomere length is stable in several immortal human-cell lines, suggesting that a regulatory mechanism exists for limiting telomere elongation by telomerase. Here we show that the human telomeric-repeat binding factor {TRF1} (ref. 8) is involved in this regulation. Long-term overexpression of {TRF1} in the telomerase-positive tumour-cell line {HT1080} resulted in a gradual and progressive telomere shortening. Conversely, telomere elongation was induced by expression of a dominant-negative {TRF1} mutant that inhibited binding of endogenous {TRF1} to telomeres. Our results identify {TRF1} as a suppressor of telomere elongation and indicate that {TRF1} is involved in the negative feedback mechanism that stabilizes telomere length. As {TRF1} does not detectably affect the expression of telomerase, we propose that the binding of {TRF1} controls telomere length in cis by inhibiting the action of telomerase at the ends of individual telomeres.},

Here, the crystal structure of a domain of human {TPP1} reveals an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold that is structurally similar to the $\beta$-subunit of the telomere end-binding protein of a ciliated protozoan, suggesting that {TPP1} is the missing $\beta$-subunit of human {POT1} protein.

Chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization {(CO-FISH)} differs from standard {FISH} in its ability to make hybridizations strand-specific. The procedure works by culturing cells for a single round of replication in the presence of the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine {(BrdU)}, thus incorporating {BrdU} into the newly synthesized daughter strands. The daughter strands are then specifically removed through nuclease digestion, leaving single-stranded chromosomal {DNA}, which is an ideal target for hybridization of single-stranded probes. Overall, the effect is to produce single-sided signals. {CO-FISH} allows the investigator to determine the relative orientation of two or more {DNA} sequences along a chromosome. With a suitable reference probe (such as a telomere), {CO-FISH} can also determine the absolute 5'-to-3' direction of a {DNA} sequence relative to the short-arm-to-long-arm axis of the chromosome. This protocol describes the {CO-FISH} procedure, which uses a peptide nucleic acid {(PNA)} probe.},

	abstract = {Telomere dysfunction may result in chromosomal abnormalities, {DNA} damage responses, and even cancer. Early studies in lower organisms have helped to establish the crucial role of telomerase and telomeric proteins in maintaining telomere length and protecting telomere ends. In Oxytricha nova, telomere G-overhangs are protected by the {TEBP-alpha/beta} heterodimer. Human telomeres contain duplex telomeric repeats with 3' single-stranded G-overhangs, and may fold into a t-loop structure that helps to shield them from being recognized as {DNA} breaks. Additionally, the {TEBP-alpha} homologue, {POT1}, which binds telomeric single-stranded {DNA} {(ssDNA)}, associates with multiple telomeric proteins (for example, {TPP1}, {TIN2}, {TRF1}, {TRF2} and {RAP1)} to form the six-protein telosome/shelterin and other subcomplexes. These telomeric protein complexes in turn interact with diverse pathways to form the telomere interactome for telomere maintenance. However, the mechanisms by which the {POT1-containing} telosome communicates with telomerase to regulate telomeres remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that {TPP1} is a putative mammalian homologue of {TEBP-beta} and contains a predicted amino-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding {(OB)} fold. {TPP1-POT1} association enhanced {POT1} affinity for telomeric {ssDNA.} In addition, the {TPP1} {OB} fold, as well as {POT1-TPP1} binding, seemed critical for {POT1-mediated} telomere-length control and telomere-end protection in human cells. Disruption of {POT1-TPP1} interaction by dominant negative {TPP1} expression or {RNA} interference {(RNAi)} resulted in telomere-length alteration and {DNA} damage responses. Furthermore, we offer evidence that {TPP1} associates with the telomerase in a {TPP1-OB-fold-dependent} manner, providing a physical link between telomerase and the telosome/shelterin complex. Our findings highlight the critical role of {TPP1} in telomere maintenance, and support a yin-yang model in which {TPP1} and {POT1} function as a unit to protect human telomeres, by both positively and negatively regulating telomerase access to telomere {DNA.}},
