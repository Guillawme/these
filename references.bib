Using such a substrate to trap the covalent {protein-DNA} intermediate, coupled with affinity purification and mass spectroscopy, we report a new, non-radioactive approach to directly determine the position of the amino acid in the protein, which is linked to the {DNA.} We report that tyrosine 335 is the active site nucleophile in {ResT}, strengthening the link between {ResT} and tyrosine recombinases/type {IB} topoisomerases. However, a distinct pattern of catalytic residues with similarities, but distinct differences from the above enzymes was suggested. The differences include the apparent absence of a general acid catalyst, as well as the dispensability of the final histidine in the {RKHRHY} hexad.

The B. burgdorferi telomere resolvase {ResT} generates the hairpin telomeres from replication intermediates in a reaction with mechanistic similarities to that catalyzed by type {IB} topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. We report here the unexpected ability of {ResT} to catalyze the fusion of hairpin telomeres in a reversal of the telomere resolution reaction.

The termini of linear chromosomes are protected by specialized {DNA} structures known as telomeres that also facilitate the complete replication of {DNA} ends. The simplest type of telomere is a covalently closed {DNA} hairpin structure found in linear chromosomes of prokaryotes and viruses. Bidirectional replication of a chromosome with hairpin telomeres produces a catenated circular dimer that is subsequently resolved into unit-length chromosomes by a dedicated {DNA} cleavage-rejoining enzyme known as a hairpin telomere resolvase (protelomerase). Here we report a crystal structure of the protelomerase {TelK} from Klebsiella oxytoca phage {$\phi$KO2}, in complex with the palindromic target {DNA.} The structure shows the {TelK} dimer destabilizes base pairing interactions to promote the refolding of cleaved {DNA} ends into two hairpin ends. We propose that the hairpinning reaction is made effectively irreversible by a unique protein-induced distortion of the {DNA} substrate that prevents religation of the cleaved {DNA} substrate.},

The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed {DNA} hairpins or hairpin telomeres. Replication of these elements involves a unique reaction, called telomere resolution, to produce hairpin telomeres from replicative intermediates. The telomere resolvase, {ResT}, is thought to contribute to the genetic flux of the linear molecules by promoting stabilized telomere fusions. Telomere resolvases are related to the tyrosine recombinases and {ResT} can generate the crucial reaction intermediate of this class of enzyme, the Holliday junction.

Understanding the extent of the diversity of genome organisation, the processes that create it, and its consequences is particularly important for two key reasons. Firstly, it is relevant for our understanding of the genetic basis for the astounding diversity of life on Earth. Elucidating the mechanisms and processes underlying such diversity has been, and remains, one of the central goals of biological research. Secondly, it helps prepare us for our analysis of new genomes. For example, knowing that plasmids can be circular or linear, we know to check for circularity or linearity in a plasmid we encounter for the first time (if this is relevant for our analysis). This article provides an overview of variation and diversity in several aspects of genome organisation and architecture, including the number, size, ploidy, composition {(RNA} or {DNA)}, packaging, and topology of the molecules encoding the genome. Additionally, it reviews differences in selected genomic features, i.e. telomeres, centromeres, {DNA} replication origins, and sex chromosomes. To put this in context, it incorporates a brief survey of organism diversity and the tree of life, and ends with a discussion of mutation mechanisms and inheritance, and explanations of key terms used to describe genomic variation.},

The telomeres of its unusual linear chromosome are covalently closed hairpins. The circular and linear chromosomes co-segregate and are stably maintained in the organism. We have determined the sequence of the two ends of the linear chromosome thus completing the previously published genome sequence of A. tumefaciens C58. We found that the telomeres carry nearly identical 25-bp sequences at the hairpin ends that are related by dyad symmetry. We further showed that its Atu2523 gene encodes a protelomerase (resolvase) and that the purified enzyme can generate the linear chromosomal closed hairpin ends in a sequence-specific manner. Agrobacterium protelomerase, whose presence is apparently limited to biovar 1 strains, acts via a cleavage-and-religation mechanism by making a pair of transient staggered nicks invariably at 6-bp spacing as the reaction intermediate. The enzyme can be significantly shortened at both the N and C termini and still maintain its enzymatic activity. Although the full-length enzyme can uniquely bind to its product telomeres, the N-terminal truncations cannot. The target site can also be shortened from the native 50-bp inverted repeat to 26 bp; thus, the Agrobacterium hairpin-generating system represents the most compact activity of all hairpin linear chromosome- and plasmid-generating systems to date. The biochemical analyses of the protelomerase reactions further revealed that the tip of the hairpin telomere may be unusually polymorphically capable of accommodating any nucleotide.},

Linear topology and {telA} distributions within this bacterial family was screened by pulse field gel electrophoresis and {PCR.} In A. rubi, A. larrymoorei, Rhizobium skierniewicense, A. viscosum, Agrobacterium sp. {NCPPB} 1650, and every genomospecies of the biovar {1/A.} tumefaciens species complex (including R. pusense, A. radiobacter, A. fabrum, R. nepotum plus seven other unnamed genomospecies), linear chromid topologies were retrieved concomitantly with {telA} presence, whereas the remote species A. vitis, Allorhizobium undicola, Rhizobium rhizogenes and Ensifer meliloti harbored a circular chromid as well as no {telA} gene. Moreover, the {telA} phylogeny is congruent with that of {recA} used as a marker gene of the Agrobacterium phylogeny. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that single acquisition of {telA} by an ancestor was the founding event of a large and diverse clade characterized by the presence of a linear chromid. This clade, characterized by unusual genome architecture, appears to be a relevant candidate to serve as a basis for a possible redefinition of the controversial Agrobacterium genus.
